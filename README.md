I completed 55 SQL practice questions using real-world sales data to master everything from basic queries to advanced analytical operations—building the strong data-handling foundation required for my AI engineering journey.


📊 SQL Sales Analytics — 55 Practice Problems
A comprehensive SQL practice project exploring real-world sales data through 55 analytical questions—covering fundamentals to advanced concepts essential for AI and data-driven decision-making.

🚀 Project Overview
This project consists of 55 structured SQL problems solved using a complete sales dataset.
The exercises progress from basic SELECT queries to advanced analytical functions, preparing me for real data preprocessing, feature engineering, and database interaction—key skills required as an aspiring AI engineer.

🎯 Objectives
Strengthen SQL fundamentals with hands-on problem-solving
Build confidence in manipulating structured datasets
Practice real industry-style queries using a sales database
Gain proficiency in data extraction, aggregation, and analytics
Create a strong groundwork for AI workflows involving structured data

📂 Dataset Description

The sales dataset includes typical business tables such as:
Customers
Products
Sales / Orders
Regions / Stores
Employees / Sales Agents
(Adjust based on your exact dataset.)
These tables mimic real business environments and allow practice across all SQL difficulty levels.

🧠 Concepts Covered
This project covers the complete SQL pipeline:
🔹 Basic SQL
SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
DISTINCT, LIMIT
Basic filtering and sorting
Simple aggregations (SUM, MAX, COUNT)
🔹 Intermediate SQL
GROUP BY & HAVING
Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL
Subqueries
Date functions
String operations
Conditional logic (CASE WHEN)
🔹 Advanced SQL
Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, LEAD, OVER (PARTITION BY))
CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
Nested subqueries
Complex multi-table joins
Ranking & analytical queries
Data cleaning queries
Advanced aggregations
Performance-aware query writing

🧪 How to Use
Import the dataset into your SQL environment (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite).
Run the queries in the order provided—basic → intermediate → advanced.
Explore results and modify queries to learn deeper insights.

📈 Why This Project Matters (For My AI Path)
Mastering SQL is critical for working with large datasets in machine learning pipelines.
This project helped me learn:
How to extract clean and meaningful data
How to transform raw data for model training
How to analyze structured datasets with precision
How to think analytically and work with real business data
These skills are foundational for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building efficient AI/ML workflows.
